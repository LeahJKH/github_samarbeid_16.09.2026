## Creating a Repository

To create a new repository:

1. Go to your GitHub profile and click on **Repositories**.  
   <img src="./images/readme/header.png" alt="GitHub Repositories">

2. Click **New** to create a new repository and give it a meaningful name.

## Inviting Collaborators

Once your repository is created, you can invite collaborators:

1. Click the **Invite Collaborators** button.  
   <img src="./images/readme/cardColl.png" alt="Invite Collaborators Button">

2. Enter the GitHub username, full name, or email of the person you want to invite.

3. You will be prompted to enter your password. After that, press **Add People**.  
   <img src="./images/readme/collabscreen.png" alt="Collaborator Screen">

4. The invited person can join in one of three ways:
   - Accept the invitation directly from the repository.
   - Check their email for an invitation.
   - Open their GitHub inbox (note: this method does not always work).

## Setting Up the Right Folder

Before cloning a repository, make sure you are in the correct file path.

- Open your terminal or command line and check your current folder.  
  <img src="./images/readme/comandline.png" alt="Command Line Showing Current Path">

- If you need to navigate, use the following commands:
  - `cd ..` → move one folder up.
  - `cd [folder name]` → enter a specific folder.  
    <img src="./images/readme/cd.png" alt="Changing Directory in Terminal">

- Alternatively, you can use your file explorer to navigate to the correct folder.

## Cloning a Repository

Cloning a repository allows you to have a local copy connected to GitHub and keeps it linked for easy pushing and pulling.

### New Project

If you created a new repository, copy the URL from the repository page.  
<img src="./images/readme/newprojclone.png" alt="New Project Clone URL">

### Existing Project

If your repository already contains code:

1. Open the repository page.
2. Click the green **Code** button.
3. Copy the URL.  
   <img src="./images/readme/old project.png" alt="Existing Project Clone URL">

### Clone the Repository

Once you have the URL, clone the repository to your local machine.  

After cloning, you will have a new folder containing all project files.  
Navigate into it using your terminal or file explorer.  

> **Tip:** Make sure you are in the correct folder before cloning to avoid nesting your project inside the wrong directory.

## Creating a Branch

Now you are almost ready to work! We will look at two ways to create a new branch.

### Terminal

Creating a branch in the terminal requires a few commands.  
<img src="./images/readme/branchMake.png" alt="Create Branch in Terminal">

This will create the branch, but it is invisible until you switch into it.  
<img src="./images/readme/branchswitch.png" alt="Switch Branch in Terminal">

Switching will move you into the new branch. In the bottom-left corner of VS Code, you can see the name of the branch you are currently on.  
<img src="./images/readme/currbranch.png" alt="Current Branch in VS Code">

At this point, the branch is still not on GitHub. You will need to push it up.  
<img src="./images/readme/upstream.png" alt="Push Branch Upstream">

Once the branch has been pushed, it will appear on GitHub.  
From this point on, you can simply use `git push` without adding `--set-upstream`.

---

### VS Code Buttons

Using VS Code buttons is much simpler:

1. Click the branch name in the bottom-left corner. You will be prompted to either switch to another branch or create a new one.
2. **Create Branch** → creates a branch from the one you are currently on.  
   **Create Branch From...** → lets you choose which branch to base the new one on.  
   <img src="./images/readme/newbranch.png" alt="Create Branch in VS Code">

3. Once you have created the branch, the branch name will update.  
   To send it to GitHub, click the **cloud icon** or go into **Source Control** and press the cloud button.

## Push and Pull

With Git, there are always two main ways to push and pull — through the terminal or through VS Code.

### Terminal

We have a few important commands for syncing with GitHub.

To fetch all new branches and updates (without applying them yet), write:

**git fetch**

This downloads all new information from GitHub, such as new branches or commits.

To apply the fetched changes to your working branch, write:

**git pull**

This updates your current branch with the latest version from GitHub.

When it’s time to push your changes up to GitHub, use these three commands:

**git add .** → adds all changed files.  
(You can replace the dot with a file name if you only want to add one file.)

**git commit -m "Your message here"** → commits your changes.  
A commit message should be short and descriptive, for example:  
*“Added images and fixed footer layout.”*

**git push** → sends your changes to GitHub.  
If it’s your first time pushing this branch, you may need to add `--set-upstream` once.

---

### VS Code

In VS Code, everything can be done with just a few button clicks.

To fetch and pull updates:  
<img src="./images/readme/currbranch.png" alt="VS Code Branch Button">

Click the **circular arrow icon** — it will spin as it fetches and pulls updates.  
Once done, your local copy will be in sync with GitHub.

For pushing changes:  
<img src="./images/readme/commitVS.png" alt="VS Code Commit Interface">

1. The **plus (+)** icon adds all files (like `git add`).
2. Type your commit message in the text box.
3. Click **Commit** (twice, if prompted).
   - If you see a warning box about “staged commits,” you can safely accept it.
4. Finally, click the **cloud icon** to push your changes to GitHub.

---

## Merge

Merging combines code from one branch into another.  
As always, you can do this either in the terminal or directly on GitHub.

### Terminal

<img src="./images/readme/currbranch.png" alt="Current Branch in VS Code">

First, make sure you are **on the branch you want to merge into**.  
For example, if you want to merge *Branch2* into *main*, switch to *main* first.

Then write:

**git merge Branch2**

If there are no conflicts, the merge will complete immediately.

---

### GitHub Website

You can also merge branches using GitHub’s pull request system.

1. Open your repository on GitHub and go to the **Pull Requests** tab.  
   <img src="./images/readme/newPull.png" alt="New Pull Request Button">

2. Click the **New Pull Request** button.  
   <img src="./images/readme/base.png" alt="Base and Compare Branches">

   - **Base:** the branch that will receive the changes.  
   - **Compare:** the branch that contains the changes.

3. Once you’ve selected the correct branches, click **Create Pull Request**.  
   <img src="./images/readme/create.png" alt="Create Pull Request Button">

   > If the button is greyed out, it means there’s a conflict that must be resolved first.

4. Add a title and description.  
   <img src="./images/readme/fullTXT.png" alt="Pull Request Description">

   - The title should be short and descriptive (like a commit message).  
   - The description can include more detail about what was changed and why.

5. Click **Create Pull Request** again, and you’ll see the confirmation screen.  
   <img src="./images/readme/noErr.png" alt="Pull Request Ready to Merge">

6. Finally, click **Merge Pull Request** to complete the merge.  
   > If there are conflicts, the button will be greyed out until they are resolved.
